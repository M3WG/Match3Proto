# Tetra Forma prototype
**Tetra Forma** is a hotseat strategy game for up to four players that draws on the match 3 and turn based strategy genres, while also taking inspiration from games like Minesweeper and Tetris. This project is both a game and an engine prototype.

## Roadmap
- Implement remaining alpha features
- Improve and clean up codebase for extensibility
- Complete documentation and contribution guidelines
- Release engine under GPL
- Host a game jam where the engine is the theme

## Dedication
In memory of [@krazyhades](https://github.com/krazyhades), whose passion for games drove our team to extend an initial idea into something with the potential to excite the imaginations of a wide variety of players.
We hope you're proud.
