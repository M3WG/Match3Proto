# Max Terra game engine
The **Max Terra** game engine is a toolkit for building 2d games with vanilla HTML, CSS, and JS.

Games typically leverage maps and cells to create a playing field.
Utilities for selecting contiguous cells and matching shapes are provided.
All base models and UI components are fully extensible for complete customization.

## Example project
Please see the `example/` directory to see how a hotseat strategy game could be implemented with this engine.

## Roadmap
- Clearly split code between the engine and its example project
- Implement remaining alpha features
- Improve and clean up codebase for extensibility
- Complete documentation and contribution guidelines
- Release engine under GPL
- Host a game jam where the engine is the theme

## Dedication
In memory of [@krazyhades](https://github.com/krazyhades), whose passion for games drove our team to extend an initial idea into something with the potential to excite the imaginations of a wide variety of players.
We hope you're proud.
