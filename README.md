# Max Terra
**Max Terra** is a toolkit for building 2d games with vanilla HTML, CSS, and JS.

Games typically leverage maps and cells to create a playing field.
Utilities for selecting contiguous cells and matching shapes are provided.
All base models and UI components are fully extensible for complete customization.

## Example projects
Please see the `example/` directory for projects to get you started:
- **[example/tic-tac-toe](example/tic-tac-toe)**: The simplest possible example with many areas for improvement.
- **[example/tetra-forma-prototype](example/tetra-forma-prototype)**: Tetra Forma is the hotseat strategy game that inspired this project.

## Roadmap
- Implement remaining alpha features
- Complete documentation
- Host a game jam where the engine is the theme

## Dedication
In memory of [@krazyhades](https://github.com/krazyhades), whose passion for games drove our team to extend an initial idea into something with the potential to excite the imaginations of a wide variety of players.
We hope you're proud.
